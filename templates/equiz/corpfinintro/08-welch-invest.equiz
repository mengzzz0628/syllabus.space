:N: Q08.1

:Q: An asset has 4 possible rates of return, all equally likely: 5%, -6%,
    8%, and $x:0%.  What is the expected rate of return for this asset? (Display rate of return as a decimal. i.e. 10% rate of return = .1)

:I: $x= rseq(-7,15); $ror= ((5-6+8+$x)/4); $ANS=$ror/100

:A: The expected rate of return is E(rate of return) =
    [(5-6+8+$x:0)/4]% = $ror% = $ANS:4

:T: 2

:E:


:N: Q08.2

:Q: An asset has 4 possible rates of return, all equally likely: 5%, -6%,
    8%, and $x:0%.  What is the standard deviation of this assets return? (Report as a percent)

:I: $x=rseq(-7, 15); $ror= ((5-6+8+$x)/4);
    $var= .25*((5 -$ror)**2 + (-6 -$ror)**2 + (8 -$ror)**2 + ($x -$ror)**2);
    $ANS=$var^0.5

:A: First, compute the expected rate of return.  E(rate of return) =
    [(5-6+8+$x:0)/4]% = $ror% .  Now, compute the variance of the
    assets returns.  Var(asset) = ((5-$ror)^2 + (-6 -$ror)^2 + (8
    -$ror)^2 + ($x -$ror)^2) / 4 = $var%%.  Then, since standard
    deviation is the square root of variance, SD(asset) = $var%%^0.5 =
    $ANS%

:N: Q08.3

:Q: Asset A has two possible, equally likely, rates of return: (k-5)% or
    (k+5)%.  Asset B also has two possible, equally likely, rates of return:
    k% or (k+10)%.  Show (i.e.  prove!) that the variance of both assets are
    equal for all values of k, and use this to explain which asset a
    rational investor would prefer.  (Clearly you will not be able to report
    your proof, but it is a good exercise)

:I: $ANS=2

:C: A is preferred | B is preferred

:A: First, to compute the variance of the rates of return, one must compute
    the expected rate of return.  For assets A and B, the expected rate of
    return is k% and (k+5)%, respectively.  Thus, B has a higher expected
    return than A.  Now consider the expressions for the variance of each
    asset: Var(A) = ( [(k+5) - k]^2 + [(k-5) - k]^2 ) / 2 = (25+25)/2 = 25.
    (Thus, SD(A) = sqrt(25) = 5).  Var(B) = ( [k - (k+5)]^2 + [(k+10) -
    (k+5)]^2 ) / 2 = (25+25)/2 = 25 = Var(A).  QED.  Thus, Var(A) = Var(B)
    and SD(A) = SD(B).  Thus, it is shown that the variance of each asset is
    equal.  This should intuitively make sense, since in each case, the two
    possible outcomes deviate from the expected outcome by 5% (which, you
    may notice, is the standard deviation of each asset as well!) This
    information would be useful to the rational investor, because asset B
    exposes the investor to the same level of risk as asset A, but with an
    expected return 5% greater.  Thus, he would prefer asset B.

:N: Q08.4

:Q: Consider two assets, A and B.  In situation 1, they make 4% and 10%,
     respectively.  In situation 2, they both make 5%.  In situation 3, they
     make 6% and 0%, respectively.  Find the expected rates of return for
     assets A and B.  Which asset would an investor that cares only about
     expected return and risk probably prefer?
:I: $ANS=1

:C: A is Preferred | B is Preferred | A and B are the Same

:A: Expected return for asset A = (4+5+6)%*(1/3) = 5%.  Expected return for
     asset B = (10+5+0)%*(1/3) = 5%.  A rational investor would observe that
     the variance (risk) of asset B is greater for the same expected reward,
     and would thus prefer to invest in asset A.

:N: Q08.5

:Q: Consider two assets, A and B, with the following equally likely rates of
    return: A will return either $a1, $a2, or $a3.  B will return
    either $b1%, $b2%, or $b3%.  Find the expected rates of return for
    assets A and B.  Which asset would an investor who cares only about
    expected return and risk probably prefer?

:I: $a1= rseq(2.5, 7.5, 0.5); $a2=rseq(2.5, 8.5, 0.5); $a3=rseq(2.5, 7.5, 0.5);
    $b1= rseq(2.5, 7.5, 0.5); $b2=rseq(2.5, 8.5, 0.5); $b3=rseq(2.5, 7.5, 0.5);
    $erA=mean($a1,$a2,$a3); $sdA=sd($a1,$a2,$a3);
    $erB=mean($b1,$b2,$b3); $sdB=sd($b1,$b2,$b3); 
    $ANS= (($erB==$erA)&&($sdB==$sdA)) ? 3 :
	  (($erB>=$erA)&&($sdB<=$sdA)) ? 2 :
	  (($erB<=$erA)&&($sdB>=$sdA)) ? 1 : 4

:C: A is better | B is better | Equal | Not Clear

:A: The expected rate of return of A is $erA, its sd is $sdA.  The expected
    rate of return of B is $erB, its sd is $sdB.  Thus, the correct answer
    is $ANS.

:N: Q08.6

:Q: Consider two assets, A and B.  A earns 4%, -5%, or 3%, in scenarios 1,
     2, and 3.  B earns -5%, 3%, or 4%, in scenarios 1, 2, and 3.  Compute
     the expected rates of return and Std.  Dev.  for each asset, A and B.
     Now, consider a portfolio of assets A and B, where the investor holds a
     fraction of his portfolio in each asset: $x in A and $xnm1 in B.
     In this new diversified AB portfolio, compute the Std.  Deviation and
     report this as your answer.  Compare the new SD to that of each asset's
     individual SD.
     

:I: $x= rseq(0.1,0.9,0.1); $xnm1=1-$x; $sd=(((4-0.67)**2 + (-5-0.67)**2 + (3-0.67)**2)*(1/3))**.5;
    $sdab=(((9*$x-5-0.67)**2 + (3-8*$x-0.67)**2 + (4-$x-0.67)**2)*(1/3))**.5;
    $nxm5=9*$x-5; $tm8x=3-8*$x; $fmx=4-$x; $ANS= $sdab


:A: Expected Return for A = (4-5+3)/3 = 0.67%.  Expected Return for B =
    (-5+3+4)/3 = 0.67%.  Note that the Std.  Deviation will also be the same
    for A and B, since they have identical expected returns and possible
    returns in the 3 equally likely situations.  SD(asset A or asset B) =
    sqrt( ( (4-0.67)**2 + (-5-0.67)**2 + (3-0.67)**2 ) / 3 )= $sd.  Now
    consider the new payoff table for each situation for Portfolio AB:
    Situation 1: $nxm5%, Situation 2: $tm8x%, Situation 3: $fmx%.
    Consider the new Expected rate of return (which should hopefully be the
    same, since the portfolio is composed of two assets with the same
    Expected Return!): ($nxm5+$tm8x+$fmx)/3 = (2/3)% = (0.67)%, which
    is the same as before.  Now consider the AB risk: SD(AB) = (
    ($nxm5-0.67 )**2 + ($tm8x-0.67 )**2 + ($fmx-0.67)**2 ) / 3 =
    $sdab

:N: Q08.7

:Q: Estimates for a project predict that the project will return +$x% if
    the market return is -$tx%, and will return -$x% if the market
    return is $tx%.  What can you estimate is the market beta for the
    project?

:I: $x= rseq(1,10,0.5); $tx=2*$x; $ANS=-0.5

:A: The market beta is simply ($x-(-$x)/(-$tx-$tx) = -0.5

:T: 2

:N: Q08.8

:Q: Estimates for a project predict that the project will return +$tx% if
    the market return is $x%, and will return â€“$tx% if the market
    return is -$x%.  What can you estimate is the market beta for the
    project?

:I: $x= rseq(1,5,1); $tx=3*$x; $ANS=3

:A: The market beta is simply (($tx%) - (-$tx%)) / (($x%) - (-$x%))
= 6/2 = 3

:N: Q08.9

:Q: Asset A earns $rA1%, $rA2%, $rA3%, or $rA4% in states 1 through
     4.  Asset B earns $rB1%, $rB2%, $rB3%, or $rB4%.  What is the
     sd for a portfolio AB that invests $x100% in A and $omx100% in B?

:I: $rA1=rseq(-5,5); $rA2=rseq(-5,5); $rA3=rseq(-5,5); $rA4=rseq(-15,15);
$rB1=rseq(-5,5); $rB2=rseq(-5,5); $rB3=rseq(-5,5); $rB4=rseq(-15,15);
$x100=rseq(1,99); $x=$x100/100; $omx100=100-$x100; $omx=1-$x;
$rC1=$x*$rA1+$omx*$rB1;$rC2=$x*$rA2+$omx*$rB2;$rC3=$x*$rA3+$omx*$rB3;$rC4=$x*$rA4+$omx*$rB4;
$Cmean= mean($rC1,$rC2,$rC3,$rC4); $Cvar= var($rC1,$rC2,$rC3,$rC4); $Csd=
sqrt($Cvar); $ANS=$Csd


:A: The four returns for the AB portfolio are $rC1, $rC2, $rC3, and
     $rC4.  Thus, the mean is $Cmean, the variance is $Cvar, and the
     sd is $Csd.

:N: Q08.10

:Q: The risk-free market asset is currently trading at $x%.  If you held a
    portfolio of two assets, A and B, such that Corr(A,B) = -1, what must be
    the return on this portfolio with equal weights of asset A and B? (Report return as a decimal. 10% return = .1)

:I: $x= rseq(0.5, 5.0, 0.5); $ANS=$x/100

:A: If you hold two assets with correlation -1, they will counteract the
    others risk entirely, leaving zero risk.  Thus, in a perfect market,
    holding these two assets in tandem should yield a return equal to the
    risk free asset, or $x% = $ANS.

:T: 2

:E:



:N: Q08.11

:Q: Asset A earns $rA1%, $rA2%, $rA3%, or $rA4% in states 1 through
     4.  Asset B is risk-free and earns 2% for sure.  What is the sd for a
     portfolio AB that invests $x100% in A and $omx100% in B?

:I: $rA1=rseq(-5,5); $rA2=rseq(-5,5); $rA3=rseq(-5,5); $rA4=rseq(-15,15);
$rB1=2; $rB2=2; $rB3=2; $rB4=2; $x100=rseq(1,99); $x=$x100/100;
$omx100=100-$x100; $omx=1-$x;
$rC1=$x*$rA1+$omx*$rB1;$rC2=$x*$rA2+$omx*$rB2;$rC3=$x*$rA3+$omx*$rB3;$rC4=$x*$rA4+$omx*$rB4;
$Cmean= mean($rC1,$rC2,$rC3,$rC4); $Cvar= var($rC1,$rC2,$rC3,$rC4); $Csd=
sqrt($Cvar); $ANS= $Csd

:A: The four returns for the AB portfolio are $rC1, $rC2, $rC3, and
     $rC4.  Thus, the mean is $Cmean, the variance is $Cvar, and the
     sd is $Csd.
