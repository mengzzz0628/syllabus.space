MORE IMPORTANT

* https rather than http (joel berger, mojolicious hypnotoad)

* use Paypal micropayments as 2FA for instructors and/or special sites (e.g., book.ivo-welch.info/instructor)


MEDIUM IMPORTANT

* add more automatic tests, esp with respect to web controller

* unenroll from a course?  course info stays, but student does not see it in signed-up list?


LESS IMPORTANT

* users can limit authentication to specific method only (e.g., via email only, via google only, via facebook only, via local only)

* maybe prevent original instructor from being removed by TA

* grep all Model/Model.pm functions for sudo double-security safety

* add permanent testsite, instructor read-only  readonly.testsite.syllabus.space

* too many INSTRUCTOR files in class directory.  maybe use setflag and getflag for empty files?

* could enhance honeypot with dozens of hidden fields and one real one, which is indicated by a token

* maybe bulk registration of students, with limits to authentication to local method

* make market for instructors and students
